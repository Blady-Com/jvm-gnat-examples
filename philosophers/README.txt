This directory contains a JGNAT demonstration that compiles and executes an
Ada 95 Dining Philosophers gnapplet that was originally developed by Michael
Feldman (professor at George Washington University) as a text application and
was later modified and turned into a gnapplet by Wiljan Derks, ITEC, Philips
Semiconductors.

To execute the demo, simply type 'make run'.
