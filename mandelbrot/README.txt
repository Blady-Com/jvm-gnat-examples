This directory contains a demonstration of a simple graphics application
compiled with JGNAT that executes on the Java Virtual Machine.  The program
interfaces with some of the Java API classes to open a window, create some
graphics, and react to user events.

To execute the demo, type 'make run'. This will pop up a window in which the
applet will run (generation of a Mandelbrot fractal pattern).

WARNING for WINDOWS users: to properly see this application, once the window
appears with the "Compute" button, and before clicking on the "Compute"
button, enlarge the window to a full window by clicking on the enlarge window
button on the top right hand side of the window.
