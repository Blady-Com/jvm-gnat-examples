This directory contains a demonstration program for a small gnapplet (GNAT
applet), implemented in Ada and compiled with JGNAT.  It illustrates use of
the Java API graphics classes to implement a simple-minded tic-tac-toe
program.

To execute the demo, type 'make run'. This will pop up a window in which the
gnapplet will run.  Note that the gnapplet is invoked via the Java
appletviewer using the file test.html.

You can play the tic-tac-toe game by using your mouse to click on the
square for your move.  The program will immediately respond with its own
move.  When a winning position is reached it will restart the game.
