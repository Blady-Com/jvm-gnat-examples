This is a simple JGNAT demonstration of Text_IO capabilities.  The
test consists of a main subprogram Demo that exercises a few Text_IO
features, including enumeration I/O, creation of a disk file, and
interactive I/O.

To execute the demo, simply type 'make run'.  When prompted by the program,
enter a string which will then be echoed.
