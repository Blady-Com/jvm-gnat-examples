<p><a href="ftp://ftp.usafa.af.mil/pub/dfcs/carlisle/usafa/rapid/index.html">RAPID</a>
is the Rapid Ada Portable Interface Design Tool.&nbsp; It was originally
implemented by&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/bios/carlisle.html">Dr.
Martin C. Carlisle</a> of the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil">United
States Air Force Academy</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/index.html">Department
of Computer Science</a>. Since its initial release in November 1998, several
people have contributed to the design and implementation of the tool.&nbsp;
Look under Help/About in RAPID for a list of contributors.&nbsp; In particular,
the new code generation for the Mcc.Gui implementation of RAPID was completed
by W. Blair Watkinson II.
