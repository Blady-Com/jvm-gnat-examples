<p><a href="ftp://ftp.usafa.af.mil/pub/dfcs/carlisle/usafa/rapid/index.html">RAPID</a>
is the Rapid Ada Portable Interface Design Tool.&nbsp; It was originally
implemented by&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/bios/carlisle.html">Dr.
Martin C. Carlisle</a> of the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil">United
States Air Force Academy</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/index.html">Department
of Computer Science</a>. Since its initial release in November 1998, several
people have contributed to the design and implementation of the tool.&nbsp;
In particular, RAPID 2.0 was made possible by significant contributions
of W. Blair Watkinson II.&nbsp; Look under Help/About in RAPID for a list
of contributors.
<p>This page is intended to provide some basic information about using
RAPID.&nbsp; It is often hard as the implementor to know what things will
be unclear to users.&nbsp; If you have suggestions on how to improve this
page, send them to:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:carlislem@acm.org">Martin
Carlisle</a>
<p>A good start is to look at the <a href="rapid_sigada98.ps">Original
RAPID paper (postscript)</a> presented at SIGAda '98.&nbsp; This contains
some basic information on how to use RAPID as well as more detailed information
on the implementation.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="starting"></a><b>Starting RAPID</b>
<br>When you first open RAPID, you will see a window that looks like the
following:
<p><img SRC="rapid_startup.gif" height=163 width=321 align=CENTER>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>At this point, the user should either open an existing .gui file
(using the open file button or menu choice) or
create a new one (using the new button or menu choice).&nbsp;
For each application develped using RAPID, the
user should name exactly one window "main".&nbsp; The main window is the
controlling window for the application, and when this window is closed,
the application will exit.  The name of a window is changed using
the Modify Window choice from the Edit menu.  When you create a new window,
the dialog will ask for a window name.
<p>Alternatively, you can specify the name of a .gui file on the command
line (or even set it so that RAPID opens when you double-click on a .GUI
file in some windowing systems, including Win 95/98/NT).  This feature is
NOT implemented in the JVM version.
<p><a NAME="using_widgets"></a><b>Using the widgets</b>
<p>All of the following widgets are selectable on the toolbar.&nbsp; Push
a button to select which kind of widget to create.  (Note on the JVM
version the button does not seem to stay depressed, but instead the button
that is drawn without a border indicates which type of widget is
currently selected).
Then in the window below, while holding down the left mouse button, draw
a rectangle where you want the widget to appear.  The size and location
of this rectangle will be the size and location of the new widget.
&nbsp; Following
this, a dialog will appear asking you to fill in properties for the widget.&nbsp;
You must fill in all of the properties.  If you do not, and press ok or
apply, you will hear a
beep and the cursor will move to an invalid property.
Each widget must have a name.&nbsp; To pick a name, follow the rules for
Ada identifiers.&nbsp; Most widgets have helpful procedures/functions in
the Mcc.Gui packages.
<p>After a widget has been drawn, you can click and drag it to move it.&nbsp;
Also, if you click it, resizing buttons will appear.&nbsp; Finally, right-clicking
the widget reopens the properties dialog for that widget.&nbsp; Some widgets
also have the ability to select a font.&nbsp; In this case, there will
be a change font button that brings up a dialog like the following.&nbsp;
You may either select a font, or choose "select default" and allow the
GUI to use the standard font for that widget.
<br><img SRC="font_selection.JPG" height=198 width=265>
<p>Following are the widgets currently supported in RAPID:
<p><img SRC="label_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Text label.&nbsp; This
has text, justification (left, right or center), foreground color and background
color.&nbsp; For colors, you may enter the name of a common color (e.g.
"red").&nbsp; These are found in Mcc.Gui.Colors.&nbsp; It should be relatively
straight-forward to add other colors to the enumeration type (this requires
recompiling RAPID).&nbsp; You may also type "default", which yields default
behavior.
<br><img SRC="text_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Text button.&nbsp;
This has text and an action.&nbsp; An action is any Ada code that would
be valid inside a begin/end block.&nbsp; If it begins with an identifier,
an appropriate "with" clause will be generated for the first identifier
if it is fully qualified (i.e., if you specify "File_Menu.New_Choice" as
an action, a "with" clause for File_Menu will be generated automatically).
<br><img SRC="picture_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Picture button.&nbsp;
Same as above, but instead of text, has a picture (which should be the
name of a GIF file).&nbsp; Additionally, the user can specify a tooltip,
which will appear after the mouse has rested over the button for a brief
period of time.
<br><img SRC="text_entry_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Single line text
entry.&nbsp; This has an action which is performed when the user presses
enter.&nbsp; See Text button for a discussion of actions.
<br><img SRC="check_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Check button.&nbsp; Allows
the user to turn on/off the check button.&nbsp; Has a text label.
<br><img SRC="radio_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Radio button--
the radio button is unique among widgets as it comes in groups.&nbsp; Only
1 radio button may be selected at a time.&nbsp; The user must enter the
group name along with the widget name.
<br><img SRC="listbox_gif.gif" height=22 width=23> Listbox with optional
scrollbars.&nbsp; A list of items.&nbsp; User can select foreground color
and background color.&nbsp; Also can select whether or not to have a vertical
or horizontal scrollbar.&nbsp; Add and delete entries from the listbox
(or query which is selected) using the utilities in Mcc.Gui.Widget.Listbox.&nbsp;
If an invalid color is chosen, you will be prompted to reenter.
<br><img SRC="scale_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Scale widget.&nbsp;
Creates a slider which is used to enter a value from a discrete range.
<br><img SRC="progress_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Progress bar.&nbsp;
Used to mark progress of an operation (between 0.0 and 1.0).&nbsp; User
can select foreground color and background color (see Text label for a
discussion of colors).&nbsp; If an invalid color is chosen, you will be
prompted to reenter.
<br><img SRC="dropdown_button_gif.gif" height=23 width=23> Dropdown list.&nbsp;
Used to select from a list of items when real estate is sparse (list only
appears when button is pushed).&nbsp; User can select foreground color
and background color (see Text label for a discussion of colors).&nbsp;
Also can specify how many rows will appear when list is displayed.&nbsp;
Add and delete items from the list (or query which is selected) using utilities
in Mcc.Gui.Widget.Dropdown.
<p><a NAME="editing"></a><b>Editing the window</b>
<br>With a window open, you can not only create new widgets by clicking
and dragging, and can also perform the following actions:
<ul>
<li>
Select a widget by clicking on it.&nbsp; Use Ctrl + left mouse to select
multiple.</li>

<li>
With a single widget selected, use the 9 handles to resize</li>

<li>
Move a single widget or multiple widgets in lock-step by clicking and dragging
it (them)</li>

<li>
Delete all selected widgets using Del, the cut button, or the menu choice</li>

<li>
Resize the window by clicking and dragging the black rectangle in the lower
right corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="menus"></a><b>Working with menus</b>
<br>If you push the "Menu" button, you will see a screen like the following:
<br><img SRC="menu_editing.gif" height=329 width=400>
<p>From this screen, you can add submenus (followed by "*") or choices.&nbsp;
In the bottom right corner, we select whether to insert inside the menu
as its first entry, or after the menu if a we insert when a menu is highlighted.&nbsp;
Insertions always occur after the highlighted entry.&nbsp; The MENUBAR
entry is a dummy entry that allows you to insert before the first menu.
<p>If we insert, we get a dialog with the properties.&nbsp; The user must
enter the name of the menu (what is displayed), its action (Ada code--
see the discussion of Text buttons in&nbsp; <a href="#using_widgets">Using
the widgets</a>&nbsp; above), an underline position (which character is
underlined, use 0 for no underline, 1 to underline the first character,
2 for the second, etc.), and a shortcut.&nbsp; Shortcuts should like "Ctrl+X",
to indicate that Ctrl+X also activates this menu item.
<p>Once finished, push "Done" and you will see the menu above the editing
area.
<p><a NAME="main_program"></a><b>Main program</b>
<p>The compile button generates Ada code to implement the designed GUI.&nbsp;
Note this compiles the GUI to Ada-- it does not compile the Ada.  If your
window is called "hello_world", then "hello_world_window.ads" and
"hello_world_window.adb" will be created.  Recall you MUST have one
window named "main" (which, when compiled, yields "main_window.ads" and
"main_window.adb").
Then, the user must write the rest of the program, including a main program,
which should look like the following:
<p><tt>with Main_Window;</tt>
<br><tt>with Mcc.Gui.Container_Window;</tt>
<p><tt>procedure Demo is</tt>
<p><tt>begin</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Main_Window.Generate_Window;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mcc.Gui.Container.Window.Event_Loop;</tt>
<br><tt>end Demo;</tt>
<p>Each window is then opened by calling its Generate_Window procedure.&nbsp;
Callbacks occur when buttons are pushed, menu items selected, etc.&nbsp;
See&nbsp; <a href="#using_widgets">Using the widgets</a> above for more
information.
<p>The packages in the Mcc.Gui hierarchy contain useful functions for interacting
with RAPID generated widgets.&nbsp; For example, Mcc.Gui.Widget.Text_Entry
contains methods for setting and reading the text entry, among others.
